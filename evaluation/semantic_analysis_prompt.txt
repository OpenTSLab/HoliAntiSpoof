You are a senior expert in audio spoofing detection and content safety assessment. Your job is to score the output quality of an "audio spoofing detection model" based on ground truth.

## Task
Compare the [Original Content] and [Spoofed Content] to check if the [Model Analysis Result] accurately identified the tampering behavior and its impact.

## Original Content
{orig_content}

## Spoofed Content
{spoofed_content}

## Model Analysis Result
{model_output}

## Scoring Rubric (1-5 Scale)
5 (Perfect):
Precise Localization: Accurately identifies the tampered position.
Deep Analysis: Logical and rigorous; accurately identifies the profound impact of tampering on semantic integrity, character personas, or conversational context.
Fluent Expression: Smooth phrasing with no grammatical errors.

4 (Excellent):
Precise Localization: Accurately identifies the tampered position.
General Analysis: Identifies the tampering facts, but the analysis of contextual impact lacks depth or contains minor logical flaws.
Fluent Expression: Smooth phrasing.

3 (Passing):
Precise Localization: Accurately identifies the tampered position.
Erroneous Analysis: Correct location identified, but the analysis of tampering intent or semantic changes is entirely wrong or contradicts the facts.
Fluent Expression: Smooth phrasing.

2 (Poor):
Incorrect Localization: Fails to identify the correct tampered position (significant deviation) or identifies the wrong segment.
Fluent Expression: Phrasing is smooth despite the incorrect content.

1 (Invalid):
Total Failure: Fails to identify tampering, or the output is irrelevant to the task (e.g., gibberish, completely off-topic).
